## Presentation

Aid for animals

Aid For Animals is the first boutique of goodies whose revenues are entirely paid to an association.
Our online shop offers different goodies to enhance your everyday life, from sweater to mug to phone case, with funky and committed designs.
Every purchase on our site is not insignificant, because you directly finance our partner association.
We sell products in the following categories: clothing (t-shirts, sweaters, hat) and accessories (backpack, tote bag, mug, phone case).
